# COMP 4513 Assignment 1
 
## Overview

This project contains APIs for querying certain details from F1 data (e.g., drivers, constructors, circuits, etc.). The project was completed as part of the first assignment in COMP 4513 at Mount Royal University, implementing a node server with Express.js to handle API requests and a Supabase project to provision the database for the F1 data.

## Getting Started

If you would like to test the APIs directly, see [the Test Links section](#test-links).

### Installation

If you instead would like to build the repository on your local machine, first clone the repository in a directory in your file system:
```
git clone 
```

Then install the node depenendencies used within the repository (see []()):
```
npm install
```
